## Which-Factors-Impact-House-Prices-A-Data-Science-Perspective

This project focuses on building a robust regression model to predict house prices using the **"House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques"** dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains detailed information on various property features such as size, room counts, location, and sale timing.

The primary goal of this project is to understand how different house characteristics influence their market value and to accurately estimate sale prices. The approach involves:

* **Data preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.
* **Feature engineering:** Selecting key predictors based on statistical significance and applying various transformations (logarithmic, squared, etc.) to improve model stability.
* **Modeling:** Comparing multiple regression models, including Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge, Lasso, and Stochastic Gradient Descent regressions.
* **Evaluation:** Using performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess accuracy and avoid overfitting.
* **Special feature:** Incorporating seasonality by adding a categorical "season sold" variable to capture price fluctuations due to changes in supply and demand throughout the year.

This project demonstrates the use of domain knowledge and rigorous statistical methods to enhance predictive accuracy while maintaining model interpretability. It serves as a practical example of applying advanced regression techniques to real-world structured data.
